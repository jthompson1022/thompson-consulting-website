        Thompson Consulting provides boutique executive and senior-level recruiting services for organizations that need high-impact leaders—and a search partner who understands both the technical and human sides of the role.

        <div class="section-title">What We Focus On</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            We specialize in roles where technology, operations, and leadership intersect. That often includes executive and senior positions such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>• CTO, VP of Engineering, and Head of Technology</li>
            <li>• Data, Analytics, and AI leadership roles</li>
            <li>• Senior delivery and transformation leaders</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every search is built around your organization’s context—your existing team, your roadmap, and the type of leader you need to make meaningful progress.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="section-title">How the Search Works</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            Rather than running a volume-driven process, we focus on a lean, deliberate search built around:
          </p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>• A clear definition of success for the role</li>
            <li>• A targeted candidate universe, not mass outreach</li>
            <li>• Structured evaluation of both capability and fit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Throughout the process, you get direct communication, honest feedback, and a partner who respects your time and your team.
          </p>

        <p>
          Executive recruiting engagements are typically structured around a clearly defined search scope, agreed-upon milestones, and regular touchpoints with your leadership team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re considering a critical leadership hire, we’re happy to talk through what a focused search would look like and whether we’re the right fit for your organization.
