        <div class="section-eyebrow">How the Search Works</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            Rather than running a volume-driven process, each search is built
            around a clear definition of success for the role, the organization,
            and the first 12–18 months in seat.
          </p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>• Clarify the mandate and success metrics for the role</li>
            <li>• Define the target candidate profile and search strategy</li>
            <li>• Conduct a focused, relationship-driven outreach process</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Communication stays direct and honest—both with your team and with candidates—
            so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="section-eyebrow">What You Can Expect</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            Executive recruiting engagements are structured around clear milestones
            and regular checkpoints with your leadership team, so you always
            know where things stand.
          </p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>• A practical, role-specific search plan</li>
            <li>• Curated shortlists and structured feedback loops</li>
            <li>• Support through offer, acceptance, and transition</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The outcome is a leader who fits your context and can help move
            your organization forward—not just a resume that matches a checklist.
